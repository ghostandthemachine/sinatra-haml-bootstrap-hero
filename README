Sinatra, Haml and Bootstrap kick ass so I wanted to make a bare bones project to
start from which would get the setup hassle out of the way. 

Additionally, I thought remaking the example projects would be a good way to get
compfortable with bootstrap and this arangement. The examples from the
Twitter.github.com site can be found at
http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/examples.html 

The Sinatra, Haml, Bootstrap versions car here
- Starter ->
  https://github.com/ghostandthemachine/sinatra-haml-bootstrap-starter
- Hero -> https://github.com/ghostandthemachine/sinatra-haml-bootstrap-hero
- Fluid -> https://github.com/ghostandthemachine/sinatra-haml-bootstrap-fluid


Setup:

  All of the example projects and the bare bones project are set up with:
    - Bundler
    - Shotgun
    - Rack
    - Haml
    - Vlad the Deployer

  To get up and running all that should be needed is to install the Ruby gem
Bundler if up don't already have it installed then run:
    - $ bundle install

  That should install everything that is need for the app to run. To start it
run:
    - $ shotgun

  As is the case with any Shotgun app you can update the config.ru file to
change Shotgun settings. Like wise /config/deploy.rb for the Vlad settings and
Gemfile for your bundler install settings

enjoy!
